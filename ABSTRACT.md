The **AI4Agriculture Grape Dataset** consists of 250 images captured within a vineyard located in Ribera de Duero, featuring grapevines of the Tempranillo variety. These images are annotated using bounding boxes. The primary objective of this dataset is to offer both images and corresponding annotations to facilitate the training and validation of object detection models. These models can find practical application in viticulture, enabling tasks such as yield estimation, fruit counting, and field robotics.

The image collection contains twelve distinct parcels, with each parcel further divided into six defined areas. Within each area, multiple rows of grapevines are present. To ensure variety and coverage, four picture samples are taken for each row of grapevines, with two samples from each side. Importantly, these samples are selected from non-contiguous grapevines, ensuring that the images do not overlap.
